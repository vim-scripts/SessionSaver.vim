This plugin automatically saves the current session vim is running with on exit (e.g. by doing :qa)

** this was created for my own session editing purposes.. at the time of writing, I looked up vim help and based my functions on tips from there.  However, while trying to add functionality to it, I also found:
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Go_away_and_come_back -- which seems to more or less do what my plugin does (and it was written in 2006!)

If no session is currently loaded, on exit, it prompts the user on whether to save the session or not.  'x' cancels, while <enter> saves the current session as 'default'.  If a session name is specified instead, the current session is saved as that.  

Sessions are saved by default to ~/.vim/sessions, but this can easily be changed according to your preference.

Starting vim without arguments causes it to prompt you to choose a session: x continues with no session, ? lists existing sessions, <enter> loads the default session.

More details (not necessary unless you are feeling more adventurous):

To start vim with an existing session, you would do something like:
vi -S $HOME/.vim/sessions/sessionName

*** However, I find that too cumbersome to type, and have aliases set up in my .bashrc... have included basic examples in the plugin file itself.
